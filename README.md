## Description 

This printf project is a collaboration between John Evwer and Hayat Mohamed. Who are Software Engineers students of ALX school. This project involves a function named "_printf" which would imitate the actual "printf" command located in the stdio.h library. This function contains some of the basic features and functions found in the man 3 of "printf".

What you would learn from this project:

• How to use git in a team setting 

• Applying variadic functions to big projects
 
• The complexities of printf

• Managing a lot of flies and finding a good workflow
